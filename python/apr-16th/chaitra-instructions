#problem-1
#solving the problem of area of circle
#formula = pie*r*r
#solution
hello chaitra
pi = 3.14
radius = 3.14
result = pi * radius * radius
say result

# Problem: Lets solve the problem of simple intrest
# forumla p * t * r / 100
hello chaitra
remember 1000 as principle
principle = 1000
remember 24 as interest
interest = 24
remember 1 as time
time = 1

total = (interest * time * principle) / 100
say total

#Problem: Lets solve the problem of Converting celcius into farnhiet
# F=(°C×1.8)+32
hello chaitra
remember f as farnhiet
remember c as celcius
F = 32 * 1.8 + 32
say F


# Problem Ask chaitra to say number 5 times
